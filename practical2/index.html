                <h2><b>1. Italian Soda at Bytes</b></h2>
                <h3>Near Block A, CCET(DG), Sector 26</h3>
                <p>When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I became reacquainted with the combination of fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have no cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask; I haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative for the times when you're feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.
                  <br><br><i><b>Recommendation:</b> Raspberry Italian Soda</i>
                </p>

                <h2><b>2. Bubble Tea at Pop Tea Bar</b></h2>
                <h3>Near Block A, CCET(DG), Sector 26</h3>
                <p>Pop Tea Bar is a newly opened cafe/bar in Sector 26. The interiors are well done with a mix of modern design and classic comfort. The place is divided into three areas: indoor lounge, outdoor seating, and rooftop seating. The inner seating area is shaded and gives a classic tone to the restaurant, while the outdoor seating is more modern with graffiti and funky wall frames. An ideal place to chill and relax.
                    <br>Coming to the food, I got a chance to try a wide spread from the menu:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tandoori Momos</li>
                        <li>Crispy Shiitake Mushrooms</li>
                        <li>Paneer Tikka Kaali Mirch</li>
                        <li>Wok Tossed Veggies</li>
                        <li>Cheese Garlic Bread</li>
                        <li>Veg Galauti Kebab</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><i><b>Recommendation:</b> Classic Milk Tea with Tapioca + an order of Popcorn Chicken.</i>
                </p>

                <h2><b>3. Latte at CoHo</b></h2>
                <h3>Near Block A, CCET(DG), Sector 26</h3>
                <p>I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing Vanilla Bean Latte, only because CoHo is the only place I've ever ordered a Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not even totally sure I know what a Vanilla Bean Latte is supposed to taste like. What I do know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I ordered on a whim from CoHo was delicious.

                <h2><b>4. Agua Fresca at Nexus Cafe</b></h2>
                <h3>Near Block A, CCET(DG), Sector 26</h3>
                <p>Nexus Cafe has a lot of tasty things packed into its cafeteria space, including agua fresca! Grab a cup of this fresh and fruity beverage before you head to the checkout line. Nexus Cafe has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, so on the next sunny day, take a break on the patio with a cup of agua fresca and maybe a burrito.
